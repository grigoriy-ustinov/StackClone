StackClone
==========
This is sort of stack overflow clone based on Anax and written as a exam project. 
You can ask questions and answer others questions, every question may have a tag or a bunch of tags, 
every question and answer may have comments. You can write comments only if you are logged in, but you can always read others questions
Almost all the code that works in this project can be found in QuestionController.
